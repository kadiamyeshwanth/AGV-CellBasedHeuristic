# AGV-CellBasedHeuristic
This repository contains an implementation and simulation framework based on the paper: Cell-Based Local Search Heuristics for Guide Path Design of Automated Guided Vehicle Systems With Dynamic Multicommodity Flow (IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 2020)
Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) play a key role in modern warehouses and manufacturing systems. Designing efficient guide paths is critical to avoid congestion and improve throughput.
This project implements a cell-based local search heuristic integrated with dynamic multicommodity flow optimization, comparing it against CPLEX and simulating multi-AGV operations.
